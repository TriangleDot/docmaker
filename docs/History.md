History
=======
So, I used to use cherrytree for code documentation, but I had to have every function as different note if I wanted it to be a different tree element.
The HTML this made was horrible.
So, I set out to create a similar application, but one with a focus on code documentation creation.
That is how docmaker was born!

Also, I couldn't customize the HTML export from cherrytree - I was stuck with the ugly, white theme.
